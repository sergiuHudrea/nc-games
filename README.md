# Summary
This project represents the frontend development of my first Web Page. 

`House of Board Games` is a board games review Web Page. 

The app enables the user to see reviews of board games and sort them depending on their number of votes, coment count, owner, designer, title, category, date, as well switching between ascending or descending order. 

Moreover the user will be able to vote reviews, but also to post and delete comments.
